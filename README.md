# 🐱🐶 Cat and Dog Image Classification using TensorFlow

This project is part of the **CODTECH Virtual Internship in Data Science (Task 2)** and focuses on building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model using **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained from scratch using a clean dataset and evaluated with custom input images to test real-world accuracy.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

The main objective of this task is to demonstrate the ability to preprocess image datasets, build a deep learning model, and use it to classify binary image data (cats vs. dogs). This project replicates a common real-world image classification workflow in machine learning and computer vision.

The project includes training, evaluation, and testing with custom images. It's designed to help learners understand the pipeline from raw image data to a fully functional classification model.

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the CNN model
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting training accuracy and loss
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For step-by-step development
